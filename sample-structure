## Standalone Tomcat Deployment
- Requires Ansible 1.2 or newer
- Expects CentOS/RHEL 6.x hosts

These playbooks deploy a very basic implementation of Tomcat Application Server,
version 7. To use them, first edit the "hosts" inventory file to contain the
hostnames of the machines on which you want Tomcat deployed, and edit the
group_vars/tomcat-servers file to set any Tomcat configuration parameters you need.

Then run the playbook, like this:

        ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml

When the playbook run completes, you should be able to see the Tomcat
Application Server running on the ports you chose, on the target machines.

This is a very simple playbook and could serve as a starting point for more
complex Tomcat-based projects.

### Ideas for Improvement

Here are some ideas for ways that these playbooks could be extended:

- Write a playbook to deploy an actual application into the server.
- Deploy Tomcat clustered with a load balancer in front.
